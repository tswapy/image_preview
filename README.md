<h1><b>A small but generalized plugin to preview images after uploaded from local machine.</b></h1>

It is a generalized plugin to upload images and preview it.

While working on an ecommerce project, i came across this solution where vendor needs to upload multiple images of a product. So i needed a generalized script where they can upload it and preview it.
